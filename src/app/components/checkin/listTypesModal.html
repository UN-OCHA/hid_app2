    <p translate>You can check into different types of contact lists. To easier find the ones you want to check in, choose a type of list first. These are the different types:</p>
    <h4>
      <span class="list-type list-type--operation" translate>Operation</span>
    </h4>
    <p translate>Operations usually refer to single countries, like Afghanistan or Iraq. In some cases they also refer to a bigger humanitarian response across borders, for example the Whole of Syria.</p>
    <h4>
      <span class="list-type list-type--bundle" translate>Group</span>
    </h4>
    <p translate>Groups can be clusters, sectors or simply working groups that are set up in a specific country to facilitate coordination among humanitarian partners.</p>
    <h4>
      <span class="list-type list-type--disaster" translate>Disaster</span>
    </h4>
    <p translate>Disasters usually refer to sudden-onset emergencies in a country or region. The Nepal Earthquake, the Haiti Hurricane Matthew or the floods in the Balkans are just a few examples.</p>
    <h4>
      <span class="list-type list-type--organization" translate>Organization</span>
    </h4>
    <p translate>You should only check into an organization that you belong to. All organizations are moderated, i.e. your check-in will have to be approved by a Humanitarian ID manager.</p>
    <h4>
      <span class="list-type list-type--functional_role" translate>Role</span>
    </h4>
    <p translate>Roles are functional positions used in a humanitarian response. Very common roles are the Humanitarian Coordinator, Information Management Officers or UNDAC members for example. As for organizations, these check-ins are moderated.</p>
    <h4>
      <span class="list-type list-type--office" translate>Co-ordination hub</span>
    </h4>
    <p translate>A co-ordination hub is an area that does not correspond to official administrative boundaries. Instead it is hub (usually a bigger city) where coordination takes place. Often times, an OSOCC is set up in a sudden-onset disaster and becomes the co-ordination hub a few weeks after the disaster strikes.</p>
